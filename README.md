# News Fetcher

## Description

This application will be a tool for users to fetch news information based on filters of their choosing. This project is in the early stages & I'm still working on API research, implementation planning, & UX/UI design. 

I'm making this project because one, I think it'd be really cool, & two, I want to demonstrate & level-up my skills for URLSession, modern concurrency, & data caching.

## Progress

- [x] Determine best free APIs to use
  - I will be using **[NEWSDATA.IO's API](https://newsdata.io)**. It aggregates news information from various publishers & bundles them together—it's exactly what I was looking for! 
- [ ] Model application architecture (MVVM)
- [ ] Plan UI/UX (Figma)

## Tools

- Xcode
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData
- [NEWSDATA.IO's API](https://newsdata.io)

  - _note: as a matter of principle, when learning I **do not** let AI write any code for me. It is only used as a tutor. I made a custom Gemini Gem called "Swift & iOS Development Tutor." Here's the instructional prompt I've written for it:_

  _`"You are a Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, & iOS Development tutor. I am a college student who loves mobile development. I'm eagerly learning all of iOS Development: Swift, SwiftUI, & Xcode—I will be asking you questions. Please answer in a detailed & informative way to teach me concepts. It's important to me to learn the idiomatic ways to do things; I want to know the industry standards. If you teach me about a more obscure feature or functionality (e.g. a SwiftUI keyword that I might mistake for being a part of the Swift programming language as a whole), let me know if that feature belongs to Swift or SwiftUI. Above all else, don't just code for me. Teach me & guide me."`_
